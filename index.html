                    <p>I am from the Killeen/Temple area in Texas. I am just starting my journey in Javascript coding and could not be more excited about this adventure!</p>
                    <p>Some things I'm looking forward to from this program:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Networking with other amazing coders</li>
                      <li>Putting my problem-solving skills to the test</li>
                      <li>Learning everything I can about JS, HTML, & CSS</li>
                      <li>Using my new knowledge of coding to create something awesome</li>

                   <h2>About Michael</h2>
                    <p>My passion for coding started in college when I began using MatLab in one of my electives.
                      I have dabbled in Python and now I am diving deep into HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
                      I have spent quite some time debugging code with fellow coders to try and make sense of what is broken.
                      The joy of finding the broken or missing piece is hard to match!</p>
                      <p>Outside the world of web development, I can usually be found interacting with friends on <a href="http://twitch.tv">Twitch</a>, crafting with my wife,
                      or playing tabletop games. I have been an avid gamer for most of my life and currently, my favorite games include Elden Ring, Magic the Gathering, and Call of Duty.
                      If I'm not spending time at home, I like to spend my time at the bowling alley with my friends. </p>
